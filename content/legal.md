## Privacy policy

ArchiUnit deals with information privacy in accordance with the Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998 (NSW), including the Information Privacy Principles (IPPs), and the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) set out in the Privacy Act. We also comply with the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) which imposes restrictions on sending emails and other types of commercial electronic messages.

This privacy policy sets out ArchiUnit's policies in relation to management of personal information.

We collect and hold the following kinds of personal information:

* your contact details, such as street addresses, telephone numbers, and email addresses;
* your personal details, such as date of birth, gender, and job titles;
* photos of you that contain your face and other identifiable physical features;
* your subscription information, such as your membership history;
* records of your communications and other interactions with us;
* records of your browsing history within the Service, which includes data such as the IP address of your computer or of your Internet Service Provider (ISP), the dates/times that you access the Service, the pages that you access and the documents that you download, the site that you came from before arriving at the Service (the referrer), and the type of browser and the operating system that you use;
* records of modifications that you make to content and to other data within the Service, including your user ID, a snapshot of the modification, and the date/time of the modification.

We generally collect your personal information directly from you, including when you use the ArchiUnit web site, and when you communicate with us in person, by telephone, by email, by social media, or by other means.

We sometimes collect personal information from a third party or from a publicly available source, but only if you have consented to such collection or would reasonably expect us to collect your personal information in this way, or if it is necessary for a specific purpose, such as the investigation of a complaint.

We collect and hold your personal information for the purpose for which it was provided to us, for other related purposes or as permitted or required by law. Such purposes include:

* verifying your identity;
* maintaining membership records;
* processing subscriptions and other purchases;
* issuing tax invoices;
* responding to your comments or questions;
* providing you with marketing material such as our newsletter (only if you opt in to receive such material);
* publishing personal information (only for data which we explicitly indicate as being public if provided, and/or for data which you explicitly opt to publish via the Service);
* analysing your interactions with our personal and electronic services (the information collected from you may be analysed individually and/or aggregated with the information relating to other members to produce statistical information, and insights from this process are used to select and optimise the services that we provide to you);
* providing information to third parties as authorised or required by law; or
* any other purposes identified at the time of collecting your information.

If we also obtain your sensitive information (within the meaning of the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)), we will only use this information for the purposes listed above, or other directly related purposes or purposes to which you otherwise consent.

We do not use your personal information or disclose it to another organisation unless:

* it is reasonably necessary for one of the purposes described above;
* having regard to the nature of the information or the circumstances of collection we believe you would expect us to use the information or make the disclosure;
* required or authorised by law or court or tribunal;
* it is necessary to protect the rights, property, health or personal safety of a member, the public or our interests, and it is unreasonable or impracticable to obtain your consent;
* the disclosure is necessary to assist any entity, body or person to locate a person who has been reported missing;
* we have reason to suspect that unlawful activity, or misconduct of a serious nature, that relates to our functions or activities has been, is being or may be engaged in, and we believe that the collection, use or disclosure is necessary in order for us to take appropriate action;
* the assets and operations of our business are transferred to another party as a going concern;
* it is necessary to obtain third party services, for example to carry out data analysis or provide information processing services (the use of your information by third parties is strictly controlled);
* it is for one of the purposes expressly permitted under the Privacy Act; or
* you have provided your consent.

We take reasonable precautions to protect the personal information we hold from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

Where practicable we implement measures to require organisations to whom disclosure is made to comply with the Privacy Act. If a third party is given access to personal information we take reasonable steps to ensure that the information is held securely and used only for the purpose of providing the relevant service or activity.

You can also assist us in keeping your personal information secure by maintaining the confidentiality of your account passwords and notifying us immediately if there is any unauthorised use of one of your accounts by another Internet user or any other breach of security relating to one of your accounts.

We collect personal information through software such as cookies. A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on the hard disk of a user's computer so that the website can remember that user. Without cookies, websites and their servers have no memory. This means that every time a user opens a new webpage on a website, the server where that webpage is stored will treat the user as new and require logon and password. In short, a cookie facilitates a user's passage through a website.

You have a right to access your personal information held by ArchiUnit. You can also request amendment to that information if you believe that it is incorrect or make complaints about our information handling practices or breaches of your privacy by us.

If you require any further information about our management of personal information or have a complaint about our handling of your personal information, you should initially contact us, and we will respond to you within a reasonable time, usually 30 days. If you are not satisfied with the outcome of your complaint you may contact us further to advise of your concerns and, if we are unable to reach a satisfactory resolution you may write to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner for further review of your complaint.

## Indemnity

You hereby indemnify to the fullest extent ArchiUnit from and against any and all liabilities, costs, demands, causes of action, damages and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or in any way related to your breach of any of the provisions of this Document.

## Severability

If any provision of this Document is found to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render the terms of this Document unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and such provisions shall be deleted without affecting the remaining provisions herein.

## Changes

ArchiUnit reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace this Document at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.

By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Document. If you do not agree to the new Document, please stop using the Service.

## Assignment

ArchiUnit shall be permitted to assign, transfer, and subcontract its rights and/or obligations under the terms of this Document without any notification or consent required. However, you shall not be permitted to assign, transfer, or subcontract any of your rights and/or obligations under the terms of this Document.

## Entire agreement

This Document constitutes the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersedes and replaces any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.

## Governing law

This Document shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of New South Wales, Australia, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
