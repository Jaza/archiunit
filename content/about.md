  ArchiUnit is free for everyone to browse and search. Suppliers can subscribe to list their products with us.

  In future, we will ask suppliers for a subscription fee to be on ArchiUnit. But for now, it's free.

  If you are a supplier, we'd love for you to be one of our awesome pioneering partners, so get in touch.

Arch degree from UNSW, and is currently studying an M. Urb Des in his spare time. He learned to ski three days before he could walk, and he's never stopped since. He's also nuts about machines that light up, and his creations have now featured twice in Sydney's Vivid Festival.

ArchiUnit is a different take on a building product directory. Created by and for architects and drafters.

Let suppliers know what you think about their product data. Your feedback affects what gets shown at the top in our listings.

Search by dimensions, building codes, colour, and more. No product PDFs, just useful data.
